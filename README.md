Final EOL Build of NSS enabled OpenWrt 23.05.X firmware for Asus and TP-Link OnHub routers.
This build uses kernel 5.15.189 and OpenSSL with Candela Technologies (CT) WiFi drivers.
As always, use at your own risk.  900+ Mbps speed wired and 700+ Mbps speed wireless.
This pushes the OnHub to the limit of the hardware's capability.
